		 "There is no way to open the can.">
	<PLTABLE "Does the door in the Mess Hall open?"
		 "If you mean the locked door in the southern end, yes."
		 "The slot next to the door is important."
		 "You'll need the kitchen access card."

		 "Amazing feat, your managing to get this far, considering the key and card don't exist.">
	<PLTABLE "What destination should I select?"
		 "Where would you expect to find people?"
		 "A large city, perhaps?"
		 "Try the capital city of Resida, Pilandoor."
		 "Don't you feel pretty silly, considering there's no way to even get the helicopter off the ground?">

	"SHUTTLE TRIP"
	<PLTABLE "Where do I find the shuttle?"
		 "You need to use the lower elevator to get to it.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I operate the shuttle?"
		 "You'll need the shuttle access card.  By now you should know how to use these cards."
		 "You can't operate the shuttle after 6000."
		 "Hopefully, you can figure out that you want to be in the control cabin facing the set of tracks, not the one facing the blank wall.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I use the shuttle controls?"
                 "First, activate the controls (see previous question)."
		 "Pushing the lever up into the \"+\" position causes the shuttle to accelerate. Pulling the lever down into the \"-\" position causes the shuttle to decelerate."
		 "When the lever is in the central position, the shuttle will continue to move at its current velocity."
		 "The digital display tells the current velocity of the shuttle.">
	<PLTABLE "I always crash at the other station!"
		 "You're going too fast. Decelerate sooner."
		 "If you're going faster than 20 when you get to the far station, you'll be killed."
		 "If you're going between 5 and 20 you will survive, but the shuttle will be damaged.">

	"SYSTEMS/LIBRARY"
	<PLTABLE "What is the medicine for?"
		 "Read the label.">
	<PLTABLE "The Repair Room door is too small!" 
		 "It's too small for YOU to get through."
                 "It's \"robot-sized\"."
		 "Ask Floyd to go through the doorway.">
	<PLTABLE "Do the Repair Room cabinets open?"
		 "You'll have to repair Achilles first.">
	<PLTABLE "How can I repair Achilles?"
		 "Waldo won't be of any help (unless you're playing SUSPENDED)."

		 "The brown spool is in the Radiation Lab."
		 "Unfortunately, there's no way to get the brown spool to the microfilm reader."
		 "There is also no way to repair Achilles.">
	<PLTABLE "Is there a good fromitz board?"
		 "Yes."
		 "Have you been beyond the small door in the Repair Room?"
		 "You'll have to ask Floyd to get the good fromitz board.">
	<PLTABLE "Is there a good bedistor anywhere?"

		 "It's in Storage East, just off Mech Corridor North. If you missed it, you'd better improve your exploring and mapping abilities.">
	<PLTABLE "TELL ME ABOUT PLANETARY DEFENSE"
		 "The library might tell you something."
		 "Apparently, it is an automatic meteor defense. Perhaps this solar system has a high meteor density."
		 "The system's discrimination circuit seems to have failed."
		 "This is probably why the Feinstein was destroyed. You'd better repair it."
		 "Open the access panel."
		 "Figure out which board is malfunctioning and remove it."
		 "It's the second board. Take it and put the good fromitz board in the resulting empty socket.">
	<PLTABLE "TELL ME ABOUT THE COURSE CONTROL"
		 "The library might tell you something about it."
		 "Apparently, the entire planet was moved into a more favorable but less stable orbit. This system ensures that the planet stays in the proper orbit."
		 "The course control system seems to be malfunctioning. If the planet was approaching its sun, it would explain the melting ice caps and water level rise."
		 "You'd better repair this system."
		 "Try opening the cube and removing the fused bedistor."
		 "You'll need a tool."
		 "Use the pliers from the Tool Room to remove the fused bedistor."
		 "Put the good bedistor into the cube.">
	<PLTABLE "Why is this Physical Plant so big?"
		 "True, this plant is larger than its counterpart in the Kalamontee Complex, even though the Lawanda Complex is slightly smaller."
		 "Perhaps there is a large section of the Lawanda Complex that you haven't seen yet..."
		 "...such as the cryo-chambers, buried deep underground.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I use the computer terminal?"
		 "Firstly, turn it on."
		 "To select an item in the menu, use the TYPE command. For example, to select item 2, type TYPE 2."
		 "Typing TYPE 0 returns you to the next highest menu level (except, of course, if you are at the Main Menu, which is the highest level).">
	<PLTABLE "How do I use the microfilm reader?"
		 "It must be turned on."
		 "The colored spools are spools of microfilm."
		 "Put one in the opening in the reader.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I summon the librarian?"
		 "You can't."
		 "Really!">
	"PROJCON AND LAB"
	<PLTABLE "What is the significance of SanFac F?"
		 "Haven't you realized by now that these SanFacs are of no interest?">
	<PLTABLE "What about the ProjCon Office?"
		 "The library might be of some help."

	<PLTABLE "Is the logo important?"
		 "It also appears on the lab uniform."
		 "It's yet another little hint about what's going on.">
	<PLTABLE "Is the mural important?"
		 "Examination reveals that there might be an area behind it."
		 "But don't worry about it now."
		 "When the time comes, you'll know it.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is Burstini Bonz?"
		 "Wasn't he the great Respectivist artist who became famous for painting awesomely phenomenal murals during the 89th century?">
	<PLTABLE "What is the laboratory area for?"
		 "The library might have some information on that."
		 "It is the laboratory built to find a cure for the Disease.">
	<PLTABLE "Is the Bio-Lab safe to enter?"
		 "Try it."
		 "Nope, I guess it wasn't. Hope you did a SAVE first.">
	<PLTABLE "Is the Radiation Lab safe to enter?"
		 "Try it."
		 "Nope, I guess you can't. Hope you did a SAVE first.">
	<PLTABLE "Where is the radiation suit?"
		 "It might be down near the Reactors."
		 "Find a light source, then use the Reactor Access Stairs."
		 "There's a lamp in the Radiation Lab."
		 "Going in circles? There's no radiation suit anywhere.">
	<PLTABLE "What is the card in the Bio-Lab?"
		 "Floyd will tell you when he sees it."
		 "It's for the Miniaturization Booth.">
	<PLTABLE "Can I get the card from the Bio-Lab?"
		 "You'll die trying."
		 "Floyd's a robot. He might be tougher."
		 "He'll volunteer to get the card if he has a good enough reason."
		 "Do you know what the card is and what you would use it for?"
		 "The Miniaturization Booth is for repairing the Computer."
		 "Show Floyd the computer printout, or let him see the warning light in the Computer Room."
                 "Then take him into Bio-Lock East and do what he says.">
	
	"COMPUTER/ENDGAME"
	<PLTABLE "What does the computer do?"
		 "The library might have something on it."
		 "It runs the automated Project..."
		 "...which is trying to find a cure for the Disease.">
	<PLTABLE "Is the printout important?"
		 "It appears that the Project was incredibly close to a successful conclusion."
		 "Then the computer broke down."
		 "If you've been in the Repair Room, you'll know that summoning the repair robot didn't help."
		 "You'll have to fix the computer yourself."
		 "Use the Miniaturization Booth.">
	<PLTABLE "Does the Miniaturization Booth work?"
		 "You'll need the proper access card, of course."
		 "It's in the Bio-Lab."
		 "Once you've activated the booth, type the damaged sector number."
		 "Have you read the printout?"
		 "The damaged sector is 384. Type TYPE 384."
		 "You will then be miniaturized and teleported into the damaged sector, where you can attempt to effect repairs.">
	<PLTABLE "I am at Station 384. What now?"
		 "Explore around."
		 "Have you seen and examined the relay?"
		 "You'll have to figure out a way to remove the speck."
		 "The laser."
		 "You must destroy the speck without harming the relay."
		 "The dial must be set to 1, so that the beam will pass harmlessly through the red translucent exterior of the relay."
		 "You'll have to shoot the speck a number of times to destroy it.">
	<PLTABLE "Can I talk to the giant spider?"
		 "Yes."
		 "Play STARCROSS.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get past the giant microbe?"
		 "Try shooting it with the laser."
		 "That won't have any effect while the laser is set to 1, of course."
		 "If you don't keep shooting the microbe, it will get close enough to eat you."
		 "Repeated shootings of the microbe merely hold it at bay, and sooner or later you're killed when sector 384 comes to life."
		 "Has the microbe become interested in anything besides you?"
		 "The microbe is attracted to the warmth of the laser."
		 "When the laser gets warm enough, throw it over the edge of the strip, into the void below. The microbe will leap after it.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get back from the Strip?"
		 "Go to Station 384.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get out of the Lab Office?"
		 "Opening the door right off isn't a healthy idea."
		 "There are some buttons on the wall..."
		 "To get a clue, search the desk."
		 "Have you opened the desk?"
		 "Put on the gas mask, then press the red button."
		 "Then, move fast. You don't have a millichron to spare.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get rid of the mutants?"
		 "You can't kill them."
		 "There's only one way to lose them."
		 "You're very close to the end of the game."
		 "Did you hear an announcement?"
		 "Remember the mural?"
		 "Go to the ProjCon Office."
		 "Go south into the elevator and push the button.">

	"GENERAL QUESTIONS"
	<PLTABLE "What do I do with my ID card?"
		 "It's useless.">
	<PLTABLE "Why did my things go when I slept?"
		 "Do you normally go to sleep holding things? You dropped them while you were sleeping. Check the floor of the room where you slept.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I read the native language?"
		 "It's actually a phonetic version of English."
		 "\"X\" is used in place of \"TH\" and \"C\" is used in place of \"CH\"."
		 "Double vowels signify the long vowel sound, and single vowels indicate the short vowel sound.">
	<PLTABLE "I keep starving to death. Feed me!"
		 "Didn't you take the survival kit from the safety pod?"
		 "Of course, that doesn't last long."
		 "There's a can of spam and eggs in Storage West."
		 "Unfortunately, there's no way to open it."
		 "You'll have to get into the Kitchen."
		 "It's just south of the Mess Hall.">
	<PLTABLE "Where can I sleep?"
		 "Civilized people usually sleep in beds."
		 "If you sleep elsewhere, you might be devoured (by grues?)."
		 "There are beds in the four dorms, and the Infirmary."
		 "Of course, the bed in the Infirmary is a bad idea for other reasons.">
	<PLTABLE "Where can I find a light source?"
		 "Have you tried burning the towel?"
		 "Okay, that didn't work. There IS a lantern somewhere."
		 "It's in the Radiation Lab."
		 "You can't enter the Radiation Lab and survive without a radiation suit."
		 "There is no radiation suit."
		 "There is no way to get a light source into the dark rooms.">
	<PLTABLE "What is a grue?"
		 "Ask the game.">
	<PLTABLE "Do the teleportation booths work?"
		 "Of course! But you'll have to find the teleportation access card first."
		 "It's in the lab area, which you may not have been to yet."
		 "It's in the pocket of the lab uniform."
		 "Slide the card thru the slot, then press the button corresponding to the booth you want to teleport to.">
	<PLTABLE "How does the laser work?"
		 "You must be holding it to fire it."
		 "It has six settings. Each setting produces a different colored beam."
		 "The battery in it when you find it won't last very long."
		 "You'll need a fresh battery."
		 "Open the laser, remove the old battery, and put the new battery in.">
	<PLTABLE "Where do I find a new laser battery?"
		 "Have you tried making one?"
		 "Some batteries are made by mixing acids and bases."
		 "However, there's no way to make your own battery. There is a fresh battery lying around somewhere."
                 "It's in Lab Storage.">
	<PLTABLE "What are megafuses for?"
		 "They're electrical components."
		 "They're usually used for repairing Reactor systems.">
	<PLTABLE "What are fromitz boards for?"
		 "They're electrical components."
		 "They're usually used for repairing Planetary Defense systems.">
	<PLTABLE "What are bedistors for?"
		 "They're electrical components."
		 "They're usually used for repairing Course Control systems.">
	<PLTABLE "Doctor, doctor! Why am I so sick?"
		 "You'll find out when you get to the Library."
		 "You have contracted the Disease. It is fatal."
		 "The medicine in the Infirmary might help a bit."
		 "But your only long-term hope is to help bring the Project to its ultimate goal.">
	<PLTABLE "I finished, but without 80 points!"
		 "You didn't repair all the broken systems."
		 "Consult the Systems Monitors."
		 "You must repair the Communication System, the Planetary Defense System, and the Course Control System in order to get the optimum ending.">
	<PLTABLE "How can I talk to Floyd?"
		 "He has to be on, of course."
